# Omniscience â€” Sports Betting TA & Forecast Engine

Omniscience is a **sports betting analysis engine** built for professional-grade line reading, technical analysis (TA), and recommendation generation.  
It transforms raw odds into **implied probabilities (IP)**, applies a full TA stack (momentum, RSI, moving averages, volatility, Fibonacci, Greeks, steam detection, etc.), and generates **human-readable betting recommendations** with confidence scoring.
